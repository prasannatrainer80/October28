Unit Testing : 

In unit testing, each and every portion of the given code needs to be tested thouroughly, and if any defects are there to be escalated and send for resolution.

Unit Testing can be done by developers only. 

In java, we can implement Unit Testing by using JUNIT. 

Junit is a testing framework, that which allows you to test each and every line of the code, and any defects to be send for escalation. 


Mostly unit testing can be done by developers 

We have basic annotations here as 

1) @Before

2) @BeforeClass : This annotation method will be executed only once before the junit testing stars, this annotated method used to handle all global initilizations. 

3) @After

4) @AfterClass : This annotated method will be called only once before end of all testcases, this annotated method used to do all clean up process.
