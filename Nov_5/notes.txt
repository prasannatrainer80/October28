Correlated Subquery : A subquery where we can use outer query references inside the inner query known as correlated subquery.


Correlated subqueries are used for row by row processing. As each subquery executed once for every row of outer query.

The subquery will be executed repeatedly for each row of the oute query using the values from the current row 

For example if I want to print nth max salary 
	
E1	E2	
800     	800 > 800
1600		800 > 1600
1250		1250 > 1600
2975		2975 > 1600   2975
1250		
2850		2850 > 2975
2450		2450 > 2975
3000		3000 > 2975  3000
5000		5000 > 3000  5000
1500		1500 > 5000
1100		1100 > 5000
950		950 > 5000
3000		1300 > 5000 
1300


so it print 5000 as 1st max sal

800		800 > 800
1600		800 > 1600
1250		1250 > 1600
2975		2975 > 1600     2975 (2)
1250		2850 > 2975
2850		2450 > 2975     
2450		3000 > 2975	3000 (1)
3000
5000		5000 > 3000	5000 (0)
1500	
1100
950
3000
1300

Data Integrity : It is imp. to ensure that the data stored in tables is complete and consistent.  The concept of maintaining consistency and completeness of data is called data integrity.  It is enforced to ensure that the data in the database is accurate, consistent and reliable.  

There are various levels of integrity known as

(I) Entity Integrity : Ensures that each row can be uniquely identified by an attribute called the primary key. The primary key column contains unique value in all the rows. This column cannot be NULL. 

(ii) Domain Integrity : Ensures that only a valid range of values is stored in a column. It can be enforced by restricting the type of data.  For suppose the dept field need to contain the list of values as 'computers' or 'physics' or 'maths' then it is coming under the part of domain integrity. 

(iii) Referential Integrity : Ensures that the values of the foreign key match the values of the corresponding primary key.
