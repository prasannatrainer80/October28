HTML will not perform

	-> Actions

	-> Business Logic

	-> Event-Based programming 

To implement above, we need the help of javascript. 

You can make javascript, by using

<script>
</script> 

You can define the code in functions as

function function_name() {
...
...
...
}

There are various types of events in javascript, as 

onclick()  : If you click on the button, then onclick() event getting raised.

onchange() : If you change status of checkbox etc... then onchange() event will be raised.

onload() : As soon as the document loaded, then onload() event getting fired. 

onblur() : As soon as you leave the cursor, then onblur() event getting fired.
