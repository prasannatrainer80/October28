count : Used to display total records for that value is not null

select count(comm) from Emp; assume we got 4 records means for 4 records values are available remaining are NULL.

count(*) : Display total no.of records of the particular table

Group By : Used to display summary reports based on the field specified

Having : This clause allows you to check conditions in aggregate field(s) specified.

What is the difference between WHERE clause and HAVING clause 

WHERE clause allows you to check conditions on table field(s), as HAVING clause allows you to check conditions on aggregate fields. 

-- Display info whose job/dept contains more than 1 employ

First Where Cluase next group by next having next order by

Normalization is the scientific method of breaking down the complex table structures into simple table structures by using certain rules. 

There are various types of normal forms we have as 

Employ(Empno, Ename, DeptCode,DeptHead,Gender,ProjCode,Hours) 

1) First Normal Form : A table said to be in 1NF, if each cell contains precisely one value (Atomic Values)

Assume, above table we have some sample data as 

E001, Sundhara Pandi, D001,Sudha G, Male, {P001,P015,P111},{88,64,56} 

By Applying 1NF, 
E001, Sundhara Pandi, D001,Sudha G, Male, P001,88
E001, Sundhara Pandi, D001,Sudha G, Male, P015,64
E001, Sundhara Pandi, D001,Sudha G, Male, P111,56
 
2) Second Normal Form : A table said to be in 2NF, at first it must be in 1NF, and every attribute in table functionally depend on whole key but not part of key. {Functional Dependency} 

Before going to this NF, please check INSERT, Update and Delete Anomolies and then only proceed to 2NF 

Insert : Employ records are not recorded until we receive project details. 

Update : The Employ Details, DeptHead, DeptCode are repeated multiple times. If any Dept Head moves to another Dept, the subsequent change needs to be updated in all corresponding records 

Delete : If any Employ project completed, then the record to be deleted from table, then it deletes all Employ details, Project Details and Dept details to be lost. 

*** 1NF is inadequate *** So please move to 2NF 

Guidelines : 

	-> Find and remove attributes that are not functionally depend on whole key 

	-> Group the remaining attributes. 


Employ(Empno, Ename, DeptCode,DeptHead,Gender,ProjCode,Hours) 

Empno -> Ename

Empno -> DeptCode (Y)
Empno -> DeptHead (Y)
Empno -> Gender (Y)
Empno -> ProjCode (N)
Empno -> Hours (N)

Employ(Empno+,Ename,DeptCode,DeptHead)
Project(ProjCode+,Hours,Empno-)

3) Third Normal Form : A table said to be in 3NF, at first it must be in 2NF and every attribute in table depends on whole key but not transitively. 

Insert : If company starts new dept, that will not be recorded until employ comes. 

Update : DeptCode, DeptHead details are repeated multiple times, so if any DeptHead moves to another dept. the change needs to be reflected in all corresponding records. 

Delete : If Employ resigns to his job, then employ details along with Dept Details also to be lost.

So, 2NF inadequate in this situation, so we need to go for 3NF 

Guidelines : 

	-> Find and remove attributes that are transitively depend on whole key
	-> Group the remaining attributes.

By Applying 3NF 

Employ(Empno+,Ename,DeptCode,DeptHead)
Project(ProjCode+,Hours,Empno-)

Dept(DeptCode,DeptHead)
Employ(Empno+,Ename,Gender,DeptCode-)
Project(ProjCode+,Hours,Empno-)

___________________________________________________________________________________________________

College(StudentId,StudentName,Gender,DateOfJoin,DeptCode,DeptName,DeptHead)
AttendanceId,AttendanceDate,AttendanceStatus)


First Normal Form (1NF) : A table said to be in 1NF, each cell contains precisely
once value (atomic Values) 

Insert : Student records are not Inserted until attendance Details comes 

Update : DeptCode, DeptName, DeptHead details repeated multiple times, if any 
DeptHead moves to another Dept, the change needs to be reflected in all 
corresponding records.

Delete : If any Student Record to be deleted, then all Dept and Attendance Details
are lost

So 1NF inadequate, so 2NF we have to proceed

Second Normal Form (2NF) : A table said to be in 2NF, at first it must be in 1NF, and every attribute functionally depend on whole key but not part of the key.

College(StudentId,StudentName,Gender,DateOfJoin,DeptCode,DeptName,DeptHead)
AttendanceId,AttendanceDate,AttendanceStatus)


StudentID -> StudentName (Y)
StudentId -> Gender (Y)
StudentId -> DateOfJoin (Y)
StudentID -> DeptCode(Y)
StudentID -> DeptName(Y)
studentId -> DeptHead(Y)
StudentId -> AttendanceId (N)
StudentId -> AttendanceDate (N)
StudentId -> AttendanceStatus (N)

Student(StudentID+, StudentName,Gender,DateOfJoin,DeptCode,DeptName,DeptHead)
Attenance(AttendanceId+,AttendanceDate,AttendanceStatus,StudentID-)

Insert : If you want to enter any new dept records, student need to join that is not right 

Update : DeptCode,DeptHead Repeated multiple times, if any deptHead moves to another dept the change needs
	to be reflected in all corresponding records

Delete : If any Student Record Deleted, then the corresponding Dept records also to be deleted 

so, there is transitive dependency

Third Normal Form : A table said to be in 3NF, at first it must be in 2NF, and every attribute in table A depends on table B, but not transitively

Dept(DeptCode+,DeptName,DeptHead)
Student(StudentId+,StudentName,Gender,DateOfJoin,DeptCode-)
Attendance(AttendanceId+,AttendanceDate,AttendanceStatus,StudentId-)


Code Words : 

1NF : Atomic values 

2NF : Functional Dependency

3NF : Transitive Dependency

Joins : Joins allows you to extract data from more than one table. 

There are various types of joins known as 

1) Inner Join : Acts as an intersect operator. Used to extract only the common records from the given tables. 

Dept 
____

deptno	int	NO	PRI		
dname	varchar(14)	YES			
loc	varchar(13)	YES			

Emp 
____

empno	int	NO	PRI		
ename	varchar(10)	YES			
job	varchar(9)	YES			
mgr	int	YES			
hiredate	date	YES			
sal	int	YES			
comm	int	YES			
deptno	int	YES	MUL	

select Dept.Deptno, Dname, Empno, Ename, JOb,Sal,Mgr
from Dept INNER JOIN Emp
ON Dept.Deptno = Emp.Deptno;


select D.Deptno, Dname, Empno, Ename, JOb,Sal,Mgr
from Dept D INNER JOIN Emp E
ON D.Deptno = E.Deptno;

SELECT A.AgentId, FirstName, LastName, City, State,
P.PolicyId, AppNumber,AnnualPremium,ModalPremium
FROM Agent A INNER JOIN AgentPolicy AP
ON A.AgentId = AP.AgentID
INNER JOIN Policy P ON 
P.PolicyID = AP.PolicyID;


2) Outer Join : Allows you to display all matching and unmatching records from the given tables. There are various types of Outer Joins as 

	-> Left Outer Join : All records from the left-side table and matching records from the right side table, if any column values does not exists, it would be replaced with NULL keyword. 

	-> Right Outer Join : All records from the right-side table and matching records from left-side table
	if any column values does not exists, it would be replaced with NULL keyword. 

	-> Full Outer Join 

3) Cross Join : It generates cartician product of two table records, as table A contains n records, table B contains m records, then it generates n*m records. 

4) Self Join : If a table joins with itself, known as self join. 

Subqueries : Sometimes it is not possible to extract data by using single Select
statement, to overcome this we need the help of subqueries. A subquery is a query, that which is having another query inside, the query which is inside known as inner query, the query which is outside known as outer query. 

Every time, the result of the inner query will be send as input to the outer query. 

-- Display max. salary from EMp table

select max(sal) from Emp;

-- Display name of employ who is getting max salary 

There are various types of subqueries known as 

(I)   Single-Row Subquery : If a subquery returns only one row at a time known as single row subquery.

(ii)  Multi-Row Subquery : If a subquery returns more than one row at a time known as multi-row subquery. 

Multi-Row subqueries can be handled by using ALL or ANY Operator. 

ALL -> Acts as AND operator

ANY -> Acts as OR Operator 

Empno <> ALL(10,20,30) means empno <> 10 AND Empno <> 20 and Empno <> 30 

Empno = ANY(10,20,30) means Empno=10 OR Empno=20 OR Empno=30

-- Display Idle Depts from Dept and Emp table 

select * from Dept where Depno <> ALL(select Deptno From Emp);


-- Display all dept details who have employs



(iii) Correlated Subquery
